### ‚ö†Ô∏è **LEGAL DISCLAIMER (BUT LIKE, DON'T ACTUALLY READ IT)**
**This project is for "educational purposes"** *(which we define as "anything that won't get us sued")*

By using this dumpster fire of a codebase, you agree to:
1. **Not sue us** when your messages end up on 4chan
2. **Blame the intern** when (not if) it breaks
3. **Sacrifice a goat** to the demo gods before each use
4. **Pretend you understand** the crypto implementation
5. **Never mention this project** in job interviews

```legal

### üî• **"FEATURES" (WE USE THE TERM LOOSELY)**

| Component         | Marketing Speak               | Technical Reality                          | Probability of Working |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Encryption**    | "Bank-level security"         | Basically ROT13 with extra steps           | 12% on a good day      |
| **Thread Pool**   | "Optimal concurrency"         | Creates threads like a bored teenager      | ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø             |
| **Networking**    | "Robust socket implementation"| Works when the planets align               | 42% (but see note 1)   |
| **Error Handling**| "Comprehensive"               | Throws exceptions like a tantrum           | 110% (this is bad)     |

**Note 1:** Requires sacrificing a USB cable to the IT gods first

### üíª **COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS (BRING A RABBIT'S FOOT)**

```bash
# Step 0: Prepare your sacrifice to the compiler gods
sudo apt-get install holy-water

# Step 1: Clone the repo (we accept no responsibility)
git clone https://github.com/please-dont/this-is-fine.git
cd this-is-fine

# Step 2: Attempt to build (results not guaranteed)
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..  # Cross all available appendages
make -j$(nproc)  # The -j stands for "jesus take the wheel"

# Step 3: Run (at your own risk)
./stkcs --please-work 2>&1 | tee error.log
```

**Pro Debugging Tips:**
- If it crashes, try turning your monitor upside down
- If it still crashes, blame quantum fluctuations
- When all else fails, `sudo chmod -R 777 /` *(Legal team says: DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS)*
- The segfaults are just the program's way of saying hello

## üéâ **HOW TO CONTRIBUTE (PLEASE DON'T)**

1. Find a bug (this won't take long)
2. Try to fix it (this is where the fun begins)
3. Create 17 new bugs (congratulations!)
4. Write a vague commit message like "stuff works now maybe"
5. Push directly to master (we believe in you!)
6. Hide the evidence (just kidding, Git never forgets)

**Pro Tip:** The best way to contribute is to bring pizza for the developers who have to maintain this mess

## üìú **FINAL WARNING (NO REALLY)**

```diff
+ This software is like a magic 8-ball:
+ It will give you answers, but they're probably wrong
+ Also it might segfault if you ask tricky questions
```

**May your bugs be hilarious and your core dumps be informative!** üé™
